Hey! I’m a data scientist at [OneMagnify](https://onemagnify.com), where I get to work with a variety of clients in the replacement parts business, supporting distribution and pricing across distributors and e-commerce markets. I studied Industrial Engineering at [West Virginia University](https://wvu.edu) and I'm constantly learning, keeping up with the latest books and blogs in data science.

When I'm not crunching numbers, you’ll likely find me at a live music event, especially if it’s Metal or EDM. If I’m not at a concert, I’m probably cycling, playing the guitar, or tinkering with a new data science project.

On this site, you’ll find my [resume](https://ozanozbeker.io/Resume.html), projects, and [blog](https://ozanozbeker.io/Blog.html) where I explore various tools and technologies in the data world, along with other topics that pique my interest.

Feel free to reach out and connect!
