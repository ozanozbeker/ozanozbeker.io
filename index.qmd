**As a Data Scientist**, I specialize in leveraging advanced analytics to solve complex business challenges, managing the entire data science process from importing and tidying data to modeling and communicating insights. With a strong foundation in R, I extensively use the Tidyverse and Tidymodels for data management and analysis, and I am skilled in importing data from databases, spreadsheets, web scraping, and API calls. My expertise includes creating automated ETL processes, developing complex SQL queries, and managing PostgreSQL databases. I have successfully led end-to-end client projects in the replacement parts business, building reporting tools and dashboards to support key decision-making for both B2B and B2C sales. I frequently use {ggplot2} for data visualization and deliver final insights through Tableau and other BI tools. My modeling experience includes forecasting, classification, and recommendation engines. Additionally, I am adept at building automated reports and executive dashboards using Quarto, incorporating HTML and CSS for customization.

**Outside of work**, I'm a huge fan of live music, especially Metal and EDM, and I'm making a bigger effort to travel and create experiences this year. I've been playing the guitar for about 10 years and creating a budget for around 3 years. When the weather's nice, I enjoy cycling, hiking, and taking photos. Recently, I've developed a keen interest in learning more about the R language outside of my direct work, inspired by the fantastic blogs I've come across, which led me to create this website.

**On this site**, you'll find my resume, personal projects, and a blog where I dive deep into various tools and technologies in the data world, along with other topics I find interesting. Feel free to reach out and connect!
