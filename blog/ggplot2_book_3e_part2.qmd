# Introduction

In this series of posts, I will be completing the exercises in [*ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3e)*](https://ggplot2-book.org/), the ultimate guide to [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). I wanted to practice this textbook to better my knowledge of {ggplot2}, but also get a feel for the design behind the package, [*The Grammar of Graphics*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0).

If you would like to see the source code behind this post, you can click on the **Code** button at the top of right of the page, sandwiched between the title of the post and the side panel.

The book is split into five parts: *Getting Started*, *Layers*, *Scales*, *The Grammar*, & *Advanced Topics*. In this post, I will be working through the second part, *Layers*.

::: callout-tip
Because this is book about {ggplot2}, I will use package-explicit function when using a function for the first time that is not in base R or provided by {ggplot2}. Most of these packages are loaded with the {[tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/)} meta-package.

The book was still in development when writing this post, so some exercises might not match depending on when you are reading of this post.
