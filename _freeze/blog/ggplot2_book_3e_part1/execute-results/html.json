I wanted to practice this textbook to better my knowledge of {ggplot2}, but also get a feel for the design behind the package, [*The Grammar of Graphics*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0).\n\n> *\"Without a grammar, there is no underlying theory, so most graphics packages are a big collection of special cases.\"*\n\nI will not be re-iterating all of the information from the book, but provide a brief summary of each section and run through the exercises. Follow along to see my take on the exercises, as well as my notes and thoughts as I progress through the book.\n\nIf you would like to see the source code behind this post, you can click on the **Code** button at the top of right of the page, sandwiched between the title of the post and the side panel.\n\nThe book is split into five parts: *Getting Started*, *Layers*, *Scales*, *The Grammar*, & *Advanced Topics*. In this post, I will be working through the first part, *Getting Started*.\n\n::: callout-tip\nBecause this is book about {ggplot2}, I will use package-explicit function when using a function for the first time that is not in base R or provided by {ggplot2}. All of these packages are loaded with the {[tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/)} meta-package.\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nIt wasn't until I was mostly done with this post that I realized that this 3rd Edition is still under development. I do plan on finishing this series, but I might wait until the book is complete before moving on from this first part.\n:::\n\n## Required Packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\n  \"colorBlindness\", \"directlabels\", \"dplyr\", \"ggforce\", \"gghighlight\",\n  \"ggnewscale\", \"ggplot2\", \"ggraph\", \"ggtext\", \"ggthemes\", \"hexbin\", \"Hmisc\", \n  \"mapproj\", \"maps\", \"munsell\", \"ozmaps\", \"paletteer\", \"patchwork\", \"rmapshaper\",\n  \"scico\", \"seriation\", \"sf\", \"stars\", \"tidygraph\", \"tidyr\", \"wesanderson\"\n))\n```\n:::\n\n\n# First Steps\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe goal of this chapter it so introduce the reader to {ggplot2} as quickly as possible. Because it's an intro, I will not be formatting the plots any further than the questions ask for.\n\n## Fuel Economy Data\n\nIn this chapter, we will be using mostly one data set, `mpg`, from <http://fueleconomy.gov>. It holds information about the fuel economy of popular car models in 1999 & 2009.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Data Wrangling, includes {ggplot2}\n\nmpg\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 234 × 11\n   manufacturer model      displ  year   cyl trans drv     cty   hwy fl    class\n   <chr>        <chr>      <dbl> <int> <int> <chr> <chr> <int> <int> <chr> <chr>\n 1 audi         a4           1.8  1999     4 auto… f        18    29 p     comp…\n 2 audi         a4           1.8  1999     4 manu… f        21    29 p     comp…\n 3 audi         a4           2    2008     4 manu… f        20    31 p     comp…\n 4 audi         a4           2    2008     4 auto… f        21    30 p     comp…\n 5 audi         a4           2.8  1999     6 auto… f        16    26 p     comp…\n 6 audi         a4           2.8  1999     6 manu… f        18    26 p     comp…\n 7 audi         a4           3.1  2008     6 auto… f        18    27 p     comp…\n 8 audi         a4 quattro   1.8  1999     4 manu… 4        18    26 p     comp…\n 9 audi         a4 quattro   1.8  1999     4 auto… 4        16    25 p     comp…\n10 audi         a4 quattro   2    2008     4 manu… 4        20    28 p     comp…\n# ℹ 224 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA quick overview of the variables:\n\n-   `cty` and `hwy` record miles per gallon (mpg) for city and highway driving.\n-   `displ` is the engine displacement in liters.\n-   `drv` is the drivetrain: front wheel (f), rear wheel (r), or four wheel.\n-   `model` is the model of car.

A set of **aesthetic mappings** between variables in the data and visual properties, and\n3.  At least one layer which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a **geom** function.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.3 Example-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercises\n\n[1.

Just plotting only those two might generalize too much across different classes of vehicles. Even though it may be true, maybe different classes of vehicles are more equal in city vs highway gas mileage vs performing substantially better in one or the other.\n\n[2.

As with regular R code, Warnings show where the code can still run but probably with not the effect that was intended, where Errors are impossible to process and the code does not run.\n\n[3. How is drive train related to fuel economy? How is drive train related to engine size and class?]{.blog-question}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.4 Q3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, class, color = drv)) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.4 Q3-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFront-wheel transmission vehicle seems to have the best highway gas mileage, where 4-wheel and rear-wheel show similar performance to each other.\n\nAlmost all 4-wheel drive vehicles (in this dataset) are either an SUV or Pickup, and have the biggest range in engine size. The smallest vehicles (2-seater & subcompact) have bigger engines and are rear-wheel drive, probably sports cars of some sort. Finally, the regular everyday vehicles like compact & midsize cars have smaller engines and mostly front-wheel drive transmissions.\n\n## Faceting\n\nFaceting creates tables of graphics by splitting the data into subsets and displaying the same graph for each subset. The two type so faceting are **grid** and **wrapped**. We will be focusing on wrapped.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~class)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.5 Example-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercises\n\n[1. What happens if you try to facet by a continuous variable like `hwy`? What about `cyl`? What's the key difference?]{.blog-question}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~hwy)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.5 Q1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~cyl)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.5 Q1-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThey both facet by the number of unique values in the variable. In the case of `hwy`, there were 27 unique values in this limited dataset because it truly represents a continuous variable. This makes it a bad choice for faceting.\n\n`cyl` on the other hand, actually represents a category (# of cylinders in an engine) although it's in the data frame as a continuous. This may be because it is a number, which is usually continuous.\n\n[2. Use faceting to explore the 3-way relationship between fuel economy, engine size, and number of cylinders. How does faceting by number of cylinders change your assessment of the relationship between engine size and fuel economy?]{.blog-question}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~cyl)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.5 Q2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFaceting by cylinders shows a clearly that smaller engines perform better on fuel economy vs their bigger counterparts, though being a smaller engine does not necessarily mean that it will have good gas mileage.\n\n[3. Read the documentation for `facet_wrap()`. What arguments can you use to control how many rows and columns appear in the output?]{.blog-question}\n\n`nrow` & `ncol` are the arguments to control the number of rows & columns. Here is an extreme example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~trans, nrow = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.5 Q3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[4. What does the `scales` argument to `facet_wrap()` do? When might you use it?]{.blog-question}\n\nBy default, the scales locks both the x and y scales on all faceted plots to show the same range, regardless of the range of values in each facet. You might want to free a scale if the axis doesn't have any values for that facet, and the missing range doesn't affect the analysis.\n\nIn this example, we don't need x-axis values for vehicles that don't exist, but keeping the y-axis values on the same scale helps to compare the values across all manufacturers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg |> \n  ggplot(aes(as_factor(cyl), hwy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  facet_wrap(~manufacturer, scales = \"free_x\", nrow = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.5 Q4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Plot Geoms\n\nSubstituting `geom_point()` for a different geom function creates a different plot. *Who would've thought?* In the following sections, we will cover some of the other most used geoms provided in {ggplot2}:\n\n-   `geom_smooth()` fits a smoother to the data and displays the smooth and its standard error.\n-   `geom_boxplot()` produces a box-and-whisker plot to summarize the distribution of set of points.\n-   `geom_histogram()` and `geom_freqpoly()` show the distribution of continuous variables.\n-   `geom_bar()` shows the distribution of categorical variables.\n-   `geom_path()` and `geom_line()` draw lines between the data points. A line plot is constrained to produce lines that travel from left to right, while paths can go in any direction. Lines are typically used to explore how things change over time.\n\n### Adding a smoother to a plot\n\nIf you have a scatterplot with a lot of noise, it can be hard to see the dominant pattern. In this case, it's useful to add a smoothed line to the plot with `geom_smooth()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.1 Example geom_smooth()-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAn important argument to `geom_smooth()` is the `method`, which allows you to choose which type of model is used to fit the smooth curve:\n\n-   `method = \"loess\"`, the default for small n, uses a smooth local regression. `\"span\"` controls the level of smoothing.\n-   `method = \"gam\"` fits a generalized additive model provided by the {mgcv} package. You need to load in the package then use a `formula = y ~ s(x)` or `y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")` (for large data).\n-   `method = \"lm\"` fits a linear model, giving the line of best fit.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"2\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(span = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.1 Example geom_smooth() with span-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(span = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.1 Example geom_smooth() with span-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mgcv)\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", formula = y ~ s(x))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.1 Example geom_smooth() with span-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.1 Example geom_smooth() with span-4.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Boxplots and jittered points\n\nWhen a dataset contains a categorical variable and one or more continuous variables, we might be interested in the distribution of the continuous variable(s) relative to the categorical variable. Because there a few unique number of values for both `drv` and `hwy`, there is a lot of overplotting. There are a few useful techniques to help with this issue:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"2\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.2 Example plot with overplotting-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_jitter()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.2 Example plot with overplotting-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.2 Example plot with overplotting-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_violin()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.2 Example plot with overplotting-4.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThough these are useful techniques, they also have their own drawbacks.\n\n|                               Jitter Plots                               |                                   Boxplots                                    |                                                      Violin Plots                                                       |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n| Add a little random noise to the data which can help avoid overplotting. | Summarize the shape of the distribution with a handful of summary statistics. | Show a compact representation of the \"density\" of the distribution, highlighting the areas where more points are found. |\n|      Show every point but only work with relatively small datasets.      |              Summarize the whole distribution with 5 statistics.              |                      Give the richest display, but the density estimate can be hard to interpret.                       |\n\n### Histograms and frequency polygons\n\nHistograms and frequency polygons show the distribution of a single numeric variable with more detail than a boxplot but at the expense of needing more space. The only difference between the two is that the prior uses columns and the latter uses lines.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.3 Example plots-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_freqpoly()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.3 Example plots-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is highly recommended to experiment with the `binwidth` as the default value is 30 and it is unlikely that 30 is the best choice for your dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 2.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.3 Example binwidth-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.3 Example binwidth-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo compare distributions of subgroups, you can map a categorical variable to either fill (for `geom_histogram()`) or color (for `geom_freqpoly()`).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, colour = drv)) + \n  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.3 Example comparing distributions-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, fill = drv)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap(~drv, ncol = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.3 Example comparing distributions-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Bar charts\n\nThe discrete analogue of the histogram is the bar chart, `geom_bar()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(manufacturer)) + geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.4 Example bar chart-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBar charts can be confusing because there are two very different plots that are both commonly called bar charts.\n\n1.  The first form, like above, assumes your data is **not summarized**, and each observation contributes to one unit to the height of each bar.\n2.  The second form is used for **pre-summarized** data.\n\nFor example, you might have three drugs with the their *average* effect. To display this type of data, you have to tell `geom_bar()` to not run the default stat which bins and counts data. In this case, it's better to use `geom_point()` because it takes up less space than bars, and don't require that the axis includes 0.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndrugs = tibble(drug = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), effect = c(4.2, 9.7, 6.1))\n\nggplot(drugs, aes(drug, effect)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.4 Example summary bar chart-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(drugs, aes(drug, effect)) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.4 Example summary bar chart-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Bonus\n\nEven if using `geom_point()` might be preferred, because the second type of bar/column chart is so popular, {ggplot2} includes a `geom_col()` that acts exactly the same as `geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(drugs, aes(drug, effect)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.4 Example geom_col()-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(drugs, aes(drug, effect)) + geom_col()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.4 Example geom_col()-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Time series with line and path plots\n\nLine and path plots are typically used for time series data, where the order of the data matters to the context of the visual. Line plots join the data points from left to right, while path plots join the points in the order that they appear in the dataset.\n\n|             Line Plot              |                                                      Path Plot                                                      |\n|:---------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|\n| Plots the data from left to right. |                                Plots the points in the order they appear in dataset.                                |\n|        Show time on x-axis.        | Show how two variables simultaneously change over time, with time encoded in the way the data points are connected. |\n\nThe two plots below show unemployment over time, both with `geom_line()`. The firsts shows unemployment rate while the second shows the median number of weeks unemployed.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy / pop)) + geom_line()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.5 Example geom_line()-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(economics, aes(date, uempmed)) + geom_line()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_book_3e_part1_files/figure-html/2.6.5 Example geom_line()-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo compare the relationship, we would like to draw both time series on the same plot.
